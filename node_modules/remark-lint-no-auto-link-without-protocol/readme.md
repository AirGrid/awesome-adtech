Warn for autolinks without protocol.
Autolinks are URLs enclosed in `<` (less than) and `>` (greater than)
characters.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-stringify)
adds a protocol where needed.

See [Using remark to fix your Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint#using-remark-to-fix-your-markdown)
on how to automatically fix warnings for this rule.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| ------ | ------- |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/master/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) |  |
| [`remark-preset-lint-recommended`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/master/packages/remark-preset-lint-recommended) |  |

## Example

##### `ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
<http://www.example.com>
<mailto:foo@bar.com>

Most Markdown vendors don’t recognize the following as a link:
<www.example.com>
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
<foo@bar.com>
```

###### Out

```text
1:1-1:14: All automatic links must start with a protocol
```

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-no-auto-link-without-protocol
```

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 …
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     …
     "lint",
+    "lint-no-auto-link-without-protocol",
     …
   ]
 }
 …
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-no-auto-link-without-protocol readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 var remark = require('remark')
 var report = require('vfile-reporter')

 remark()
   .use(require('remark-lint'))
+  .use(require('remark-lint-no-auto-link-without-protocol'))
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**', function (err, file) {
     console.error(report(err || file))
   })
```
