Warn when a heading is indented.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-stringify)
removes all unneeded indentation before headings.

See [Using remark to fix your Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint#using-remark-to-fix-your-markdown)
on how to automatically fix warnings for this rule.

## Presets

This rule is not included in any default preset

## Example

##### `ok.md`

###### In

Note: `·` represents a space.

```markdown
#·Hello world

Foo
-----

#·Hello world·#

Bar
=====
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok.md`

###### In

Note: `·` represents a space.

```markdown
···# Hello world

·Foo

·# Hello world #

···Bar
=====
```

###### Out

```text
1:4: Remove 3 spaces before this heading
3:2: Remove 1 space before this heading
6:2: Remove 1 space before this heading
8:4: Remove 3 spaces before this heading
```

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-no-heading-indent
```

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 …
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     …
     "lint",
+    "lint-no-heading-indent",
     …
   ]
 }
 …
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-no-heading-indent readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 var remark = require('remark')
 var report = require('vfile-reporter')

 remark()
   .use(require('remark-lint'))
+  .use(require('remark-lint-no-heading-indent'))
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**', function (err, file) {
     console.error(report(err || file))
   })
```
