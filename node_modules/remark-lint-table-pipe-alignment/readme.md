Warn when table pipes are not aligned.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-stringify)
tries to align tables by default.
Pass
[`paddedTable: false`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-stringify#optionspaddedtable)
to not align cells.

Aligning cells perfectly is impossible as some characters (such as emoji or
Chinese characters) are rendered differently in different browsers,
terminals, and editors.
You can pass your own
[`stringLength`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-stringify#optionsstringlength)
function to customize how cells are aligned.
In that case, this rule must be turned off.

See [Using remark to fix your Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint#using-remark-to-fix-your-markdown)
on how to automatically fix warnings for this rule.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-table-pipe-alignment
```

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 …
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     …
     "lint",
+    "lint-table-pipe-alignment",
     …
   ]
 }
 …
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-table-pipe-alignment readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 var remark = require('remark')
 var report = require('vfile-reporter')

 remark()
   .use(require('remark-lint'))
+  .use(require('remark-lint-table-pipe-alignment'))
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**', function (err, file) {
     console.error(report(err || file))
   })
```
