Warn when code blocks do not adhere to a given style.

Options: `'consistent'`, `'fenced'`, or `'indented'`, default: `'consistent'`.

`'consistent'` detects the first used code block style and warns when
subsequent code blocks uses different styles.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-stringify)
formats code blocks using a fence if they have a language flag and
indentation if not.
Pass
[`fences: true`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-stringify#optionsfences)
to always use fences for code blocks.

See [Using remark to fix your Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint#using-remark-to-fix-your-markdown)
on how to automatically fix warnings for this rule.

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 â€¦
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     â€¦
     "lint",
+    "lint-code-block-style",
     â€¦
   ]
 }
 â€¦
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-code-block-style readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 var remark = require('remark')
 var report = require('vfile-reporter')

 remark()
   .use(require('remark-lint'))
+  .use(require('remark-lint-code-block-style'))
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**', function (err, file) {
     console.error(report(err || file))
   })
```
