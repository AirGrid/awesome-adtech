Warn when table rows are not fenced with pipes.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-stringify)
creates fenced rows with initial and final pipes by default.
Pass
[`looseTable: true`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-stringify#optionsloosetable)
to not use row fences.

See [Using remark to fix your Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint#using-remark-to-fix-your-markdown)
on how to automatically fix warnings for this rule.

## Install

[npm][]:

```

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 …
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     …
     "lint",
+    "lint-table-pipes",
     …
   ]
 }
 …
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-table-pipes readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 var remark = require('remark')
 var report = require('vfile-reporter')

 remark()
   .use(require('remark-lint'))
+  .use(require('remark-lint-table-pipes'))
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**', function (err, file) {
     console.error(report(err || file))
   })
```
