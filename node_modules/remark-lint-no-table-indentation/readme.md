Warn when tables are indented.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-stringify)
removes all unneeded indentation before tables.

See [Using remark to fix your Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint#using-remark-to-fix-your-markdown)
on how to automatically fix warnings for this rule.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| ------ | ------- |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/master/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) |  |

## Example

##### `ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
Paragraph.

| A     | B     |
| ----- | ----- |
| Alpha | Bravo |
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok.md`

###### In

Note: `·` represents a space.

```markdown
Paragraph.

···| A     | B     |
···| ----- | ----- |
···| Alpha | Bravo |
```

###### Out

```text
3:1-3:21: Do not indent table rows
5:1-5:21: Do not indent table rows
```

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-no-table-indentation
```

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 …
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     …
     "lint",
+    "lint-no-table-indentation",
     …
   ]
 }
 …
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-no-table-indentation readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 var remark = require('remark')
 var report = require('vfile-reporter')

 remark()
   .use(require('remark-lint'))
+  .use(require('remark-lint-no-table-indentation'))
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**', function (err, file) {
     console.error(report(err || file))
   })
```
