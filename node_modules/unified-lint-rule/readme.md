[**unified**][unified] plugin to make it a bit easier to create linting rules.

Each rule in [`remark-lint`][lint] uses this project, so see that for examples!

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install unified-lint-rule
```

## Use

```js
var rule = require('unified-lint-rule')

module.exports = rule('remark-lint:file-extension', fileExtension)

function fileExtension(tree, file, option) {
  var ext = file.extname
  var preferred = typeof option === 'string' ? option : 'md'

  if (ext && ext.slice(1) !== preferred) {
    file.message('Incorrect extension: use `' + preferred + '`')
  }
}
```
