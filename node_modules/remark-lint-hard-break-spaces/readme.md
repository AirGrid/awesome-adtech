Warn when too many spaces are used to create a hard break.

## Presets

| Preset | Setting |
| ------ | ------- |

| [`remark-preset-lint-recommended`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/master/packages/remark-preset-lint-recommended) |  |

## Example

##### `ok.md`

Note: `·` represents a space.

```markdown
Lorem ipsum··
dolor sit amet
```

###### Out

##### `not-ok.md`

###### In

```

###### Out

```

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-hard-break-spaces
```

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 …
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     …
     "lint",
+    "lint-hard-break-spaces",
     …
   ]
 }
 …
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-hard-break-spaces readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 var remark = require('remark')
 var report = require('vfile-reporter')

 remark()
   .use(require('remark-lint'))
+  .use(require('remark-lint-hard-break-spaces'))
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**', function (err, file) {
     console.error(report(err || file))
   })
```
